# Welcome!
My name is Sonoma Miller. I'm currently an Informatics student at the University of Washington Seattle.

Informatics is the overlap of people, information, and technology. During my time at school, I've learned to code
(in Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Java, and SQL) and design (UI/UX and industrial) in order to create intuitive and data-driven
solutions to real-world problems. With a concentration on data science, I've used these skills to analyze datasets
in both my classes and my research positions.

Outside of school, I love to backpack all over Washington; one of my favorite trips this season was to Spectacle Lake.
I also love plants- you can see a houseplant from any point in my house, and this year, I'm starting an outdoor garden!
Music is a long-time obsession of mine; currently, my favorite artists are Sublime and Aphex Twin.
